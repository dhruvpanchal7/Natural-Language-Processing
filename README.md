NLPKeyTerm - This script seamlessly integrates spaCy and textacy to perform a comprehensive analysis on text data. Beginning with spaCy, the input text is tokenized to extract linguistic elements, laying the foundation for subsequent key term extraction using textacy. The script then ranks these key terms based on their relevance and calculates their similarity. The final step involves leveraging Plotly for visualization, generating a graph that vividly illustrates the relationships and importance of extracted key terms. This holistic approach facilitates a nuanced understanding of the semantic connections within the text, providing valuable insights for text analysis and interpretation.
